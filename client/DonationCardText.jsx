          <p>
            Kitty's House is a non-profit cat rescue and retreat. We foster
            kittens until they reach adoption age. We also have senior cats who
            are eligible to be adopted into their forever home. They still have
            a lot of love to give!
          </p>
          <p>Help us continue our mission and donate to Kitty's House today.</p>
